		<p>
			Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks
			like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a
			compile step that happens when you build your app.
		</p>

		<p>
			Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically
			updates the DOM when the state of your app changes.
		</p>

		<p>
			We're proud that Svelte was recently voted the most loved web framework with the most
			satisfied developers in a pair of industry surveys. We think you'll love it too. Read the
			introductory blog post to learn more.

		<p>
			SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications of all sizes, with a beautiful
			development experience and flexible filesystem-based routing.
		</p>

		<p>
			Unlike single-page apps, SvelteKit doesn't compromise on SEO, progressive enhancement or the
			initial load experience â€” but unlike traditional server-rendered apps, navigation is
			instantaneous for that app-like feel.
